So I had a late marriage and the thought of not been able to conceive or even having slightest of difficulties in conceiving never crossed my mind. And, like any other couple we wanted to enjoy the married life for few years having fun and then start a family.

I had heard of IVF courtesy media so whenever elders poked in (like in every Indian family), I used to reply "even if say 1% it doesn't happen on its own we have help around" so don't worry. All this may be stemmed from the fact that I never actually had any big health problems or so called girl problems. In fact I have had healthy lifestyle with regular workout routine and habit of eating healthy.  

When we decided to visit doctor to discuss IVF, in my mind it was like that after we start the process I'll be pregnant in no time. I was so naive and though it would be so quick that I started wondering if I should share this with my best friend that we are trying to start a family as I'm gonna be pregnant in a month or max couple of months.

But alas! the world started shattering slowly when I started understanding the complicated anatomy of human body or to be specific female body.

The first thing I came to know was about a test called **"AMH" (Anti-Mullerian Hormone Blood Test)**. And even though I have studied biology till my 10th standard and go for yearly health checkups I had never heard of this test earlier. When the test results came that's when Doctor told me the only option we have is going ahead with IVF as the other ways of getting pregnant might not work (generally with younger females doctor tend to try IUI first).

I started reading about AMH test and came to know that this basically in layman language tells about the quantity of the eggs remaining in the body (which keeps reducing after we start with our mensurational cycles) and to some extent about the quality of the eggs too which start reducing after the age of 35 in a faster manner and with literally at a light speed after the age of 40.

So the first knowledge I would want to transfer to the girls out there (who for whatever reasons whether they are carrier oriented or not ready to start the family too soon) should get themselves tested for this test. The value of AMH tells a lot about how easily you can get pregnant and it can be low in younger females as well. If I would have known about this I would have wanted to get myself tested for this may be at the age of 24-26 repeating every year or in couple of years. This test will definitely tell you how much time you have in your hand before you start family planning.
